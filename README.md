Webscraping assignment to gather info from reuters.com

In this webscraping assignment for my college webscraping class, I was tasked with building a scraping tool to gather some article
informatoin from reuters.com.  The assignment also built a bit off of doing some exercises using Quotestoscrape.com

**Question 1**
Here I used BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape 10 articles from reuters.com.  I collected the article title, date/time & hyperlink.
The program also states what it is "now scraping".  I then used pandas to output a dataframe.

**Question 2**
Here I built off of the previous program by capturing the read time for each article.

**Question 3**
In this question I used my webscraping skills to input data into a fictional pizza restaurant website.  This data was the same
as the typical information one might input for an online order.

**Question 4**
In this question I handled logins that might come up when scraping a website.  This program that I built would log you in to quotetoscrape.com
where required, allowing me to gather data on author names and the related url.
